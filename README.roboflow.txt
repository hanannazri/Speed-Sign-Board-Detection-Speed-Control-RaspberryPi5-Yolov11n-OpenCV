The dataset includes 10399 images.
20 are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 70 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -4 and +4 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -14 and +14 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.4 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.25 percent of pixels
